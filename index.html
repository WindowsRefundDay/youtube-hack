	<h1>
		Features
	</h1>
		On any YouTube video (watch) page, this bookmarklet will call an external player and load 
		some extra functions, some of which can be used with YouTube's original player as well. 
		The code is pure javascript written with the aim to be as much platform-independent and 
		backward-compatible as possible. The program is able to

	<br>
	<ol>
		<li class="feat">restrict on-site advertisement,</li>
		<li class="feat">resize, zoom, rotate and move around video picture arbitrarily,</li>
		<li class="feat">select the desired media sequence to loop,</li>
		<li class="feat">change playback rate ("speed" or tempo) from 0 or 25% to up to 500 or 1600%,</li>
		<li class="feat">load an external audio file to play alongside the current video,</li>
		<li class="feat">pick your favoured (and supported) video/audio codec and resolution for playback,</li>
		<li class="feat">download the video/audio content,</li>
		<li class="feat">download subtitles/closed captions (CC)
		<ol>
		On bookmarklet line, you can edit the value 
		of "add_subs" after the equal sign and between apostrophes (a comma separated list 
		of ISO 639-1 languge codes, such as <code>'en, de, fr, es, jp'</code>...) to add Google-Translated tracks 
		of your choice,
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li class="feat">bypass age verification (only if video embedding is enabled by the content owner); 
		<ol>
		Examples: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07FYdnEawAQ)">Tunnel Vision (signatures encrypted)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqPsrqpwLmU">Cobra (signatures unencrypted)</a><br>
		If you encounter videos like these on a playlist (while also being logged out or 
		ineligible to watch), the site's new layout will automatically throw you to the next 
		entry -- the script, however, will retain the age-restricted video's data and let you 
		continue to play it until it ends or you push the "next" button, upon which events the 
		video data for the current page should load,
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li class="feat">facilitate background play while your mobile is in sleep mode (experimental)</li>
		<li class="feat">change between YouTube layouts by setting the cookie on exit no longer works :( 
		<ol>
		YouTube stopped honoring the setting in July 2020 -- use a suitable browser 
		extension such as <strong><b>"Good Old YouTube"</b></strong> (for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/good-old-youtube/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/good-old-youtube/klkejolkjcefmocpgpjiefbpmgofahmh">Chrome</a>) if you want the 
		classic layout back. Meanwhile, YT's spf js has also been deliberately deactivated, which 
		means all navigation on the old UI will now draw a full page refresh, making the 
		site's -- not to mention this script's -- usage feel thoroughly impractical and outdated.
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
		Keep in mind that this is not a browser extension. If anything, it's an extension of the 
		YouTube video page. Any event resulting in a browser page refresh -- such as leaving the 
		current YT subdomain, typing URLs directly to the address bar instead of following links, 
		or even just navigating between two points in your browsing history where a full page 
		refresh once happened already -- will cause the program code to be removed from 
		memory and you would need to reload it.
	<br><br>

	<h1>
		Setup
	</h1>

	<ol>
		<li>Right click / hold your finger on the Yt6 link above, and "Copy link address". If you 
		have no such option, the code is written below in plain text, select and copy it manually</li>
		<li>Bookmark any web page (this one for example)</li>
		<li>Edit the created bookmark's Properties / Location: delete its URL-address entirely, 
		and paste this snippet of javascript code in its place. (Optionally, you can give it a name 
		of your choice too.)</li>
		<li>Save the changes, if there is a Save button!</li>
	</ol>
		That's it, your bookmarklet is now ready to use.
	<br><br>
		Also, in many desktop browsers you can simply drag and drop the link to the Bookmarks 
		Toolbar, or right click on it and select "Bookmark this link".

	<h1>
		How to use
	</h1>
		<b><strong>On Desktop, just click on it on your bookmarks list</strong></b> whenever you enter a YouTube 
		video you want to play around with, unless you have the code already running.
	<br><br>
		<b><strong>On mobile, tap the browser's URL-address bar first </strong></b> (NOT the YouTube search bar!). 
		After that, the browser should suggest it as an available option once you start <b><strong>typing</strong></b> either 
		<b><strong>its name</strong></b> ("Yt6" or whatever you named it) or the prefix "javascript:" to narrow down the 
		search to bookmarklets only. <b><strong>Tapping on the correct entry</strong></b> shall initiate the call.
	<br><br>
		Automatic playback depends on the state of YouTube's own "Repeat / Loop Playlist" 
		button on user-created playlists. 
	<br><br>
		Use the HTML5 emblem on the control panel to switch between the native and this 
		alternative player.
	<br><br>
	<h1>
		Background play on Mobile
	</h1>
		You won't have to request YouTube's resource-hungry Desktop mode to be able to listen 
		to videos over a locked screen -- the site's lightweight Mobile version will do just fine. Use 
		the 48k Opus audio-only format for playback to save as much power as possible. (The 
		drop in sound quality rarely becomes noticeable.) Beside the fact that picking a video 
		format for background play is pretty much pointless as you can't see it over the locked 
		screen, it would also raise the chance of playback failure significanty. There are some 
		browsers which don't like playing audio on its own that much though.
	<br><br>
		Drawbacks: the jump forward button on the locked screen's media control panel will never 
		work (by design, because they do not want you to use their site for continuous background 
		play on mobile). Plus, since there is no way to view age-restricted videos on 
		this UI without being logged in, you would have to manually skip those after you unlocked 
		the screen.
	<br><br>
		The media controls over the screen lock provide real access to the original player only. 
		When the alternative player is the active one, the panel's play button is merely able to 
		kickstart it, but can't pause it or seek forward or backward on its time rail.

	<br><br>
	<h1>
		Supported browsers
	</h1>
		<b><strong>On Desktop</strong></b>, the script should work with almost any browser now. The only criteria is that 
		they must support the usage of bookmarklets, which most of them do.
	<br><br>
		Below is a ranking of popular <b><strong>Mobile browsers</strong></b> based on how well they work under the 
		following conditions
<ol>
		- using the script's alternative player<br>
		- on YouTube's mobile interface (m.youtube.com domain)<br>
		- while the device is in actual sleep mode (screen turned off and with no connection to 
		any external power source through cable)<br>
</ol>
	<ol><p>
	<h5>
		Good ones (for Android)
	</h5>
		<li>Vivaldi
		<li>Brave
		<li>Google Chrome
		<li>Kiwi
		<li>Yandex (due to a bug, audio-only or legacy AV formats will cause the browser's sound output to die until a page refresh -- use VP9 or DASH video for playback)
	<h5>
		Bad ones (will play max 3-4 videos in a row)
	</h5>
		<li>Opera
		<li>Edge
		<li>Epic
		<li>Dolphine
		<li>Firefox</strong></b> (version 68.11.0 only, the newer one doesn't even support bookmarklets anymore)
	</ol></li>
		
	</p></ol>
		Of course it's possible to rank them differently with other aspects or conditions in mind.
	<br><br>
		Useless to go into detail as to how one is better than the other. Their performance 
		changes with every system-, application- or script-update, and it's difficult to pinpoint the 
		cause of a problem newly arisen or seemingly solved. The list reflects a general 
		impression after about half a year of testing.

	<br><br>
		Regardless of platform, the default "noname" browsers that come pre-installed on various 
		systems typically have no support for bookmarklets. If your chosen browser's response to 
		your attempt to use the bookmarklet is to pull a web search on words found on the 
		bookmarklet line, it is safe to say that it doesn't support it.

	<br><br>
	<h1>
		Legacy browsers
	</h1>
		Till June/July of 2020 the bookmarklet was usable with really old browsers too that were 
		dated back to around the IE7/8 era (with the help of the Adobe Flash plugin), but now that 
		YouTube enforces its bug-filled new layout, they broke compatibility with them.
	<br><br>
		Still, I found a way to make use of this script with outdated browsers anyway.<br>
		Obviously, it's discouraged to use them now because of the myriad of security holes	that 
		can be found in such old sowftware, not to mention that the development of Adobe Flash 
		will also end officially in 2020. But in case you have no other option, the possibility is 
		there.
	<br><br>
		The trick is to visit the "embed" page which contains a stripped-down code normally used 
		to create an embedded video on other websites. There is literally nothing on these pages 
		beside the player itself, therefore it's super lightweight which makes it a legit choice even 
		for modern browsers (if you just want simple playback in the background). It's clunky and 
		inconvenient to use on mobile, not recommended. On desktop it's okay.
	<br><br>
		Regular video URL with playlist<br>
	<code>https://www.youtube.com/<b><strong><div style="color: red; display: inline-block">watch?v=</div></strong></b>BJPKUw8QIlk<b><strong><div style="color: red; display: inline-block">&</div></strong></b>list=PLXlj3dvMsYiLWcmENQsUHEQr8Snw1PH3X&index=1022</code>
<br><br>
		The "embed" variant to enter on the address bar<br>
	<code>https://www.youtube.com/<b><strong><div style="color: red; display: inline-block">embed/</div></strong></b>BJPKUw8QIlk<b><strong><div style="color: red; display: inline-block">?</div></strong></b>list=PLXlj3dvMsYiLWcmENQsUHEQr8Snw1PH3X&index=1022</code><br><br>

		Then you just load the script like you would on a watch page. Old browser or not, it should 
		work. Albeit truly ancient ones can only get the links of videos with lighter or nonexistent 
		copyright protection (i.e. unencrypted signatures.)
	<br><br>
		<b><strong>Pro:</strong></b> the alternative player can play videos which are otherwise blocked from view 
		in embedded frames.<br>
		<b><strong>Con:</strong></b> due to a YT limitation, you can only access the first 200 videos on an embedded 
		playlist. The example above is the 1023th entry (indexed 1022) on the list, and it will load 
		fine. But once you try to navigate, there will be no way to watch anything above index 199.

	</h1>

	<br>
	<ol>
	<li>
	<p>
		If you use add-ons like NoScript (a recommended practice), make sure to
	<h5>
		Whitelist / Trust these domains permanently:

	</p>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	<p>
		The alternative player of Yt6 uses the Progressive Download method to access video & 
		audio, instead of the Adaptive Streaming YouTube's own player had as the default 
		since late 2013.
	<br><br>

		Both have their pros and cons. With the former, media is getting piled up in the browser's 
		cache during playback, which means there must be enough free space for storage either
		in the system RAM or on the disk. While in the case of streaming, you 
		only have tiny slices of the media buffered at all times, which in turn requires higher 
		CPU-power and constantly fast network speeds.
	<br>
		Consequently, for live streams or Ultra-HD videos it's recommended to switch over to 
		YouTube's native player, as it is much better suited for those.
	
	<br><br>
		To make sure your browser chooses memory over the much slower and/or fragile Hard 
		Disk / Solid-state drive for temporary storage, <strong><b>use the program in an Incognito / 
		In-private browser window or tab.</b></strong>
	</p>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	<p>
		Occasionally, some age-restricted videos may get the same subdomain for their 
		source location as known YouTube video commercials which have already been 
		registered with adblockers such as uBlock Origin or Brave Browser's ad-shield, and as 
		a result, their download links will be made inaccessible by these adblockers as well. 
		Except if<br>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>you are logged in to an eligible YouTube account</li>
		<li>don't use ad-blockers at all</li>
		<li>or set up exceptions in the ad-blocker's settings</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
		For example, on uBlock Origin's control panel, the explicit greenlighting of the domains
	<br><br>
		youtube.com -- for the player data and<br>
		googlevideo.com -- to access the media links<br>
	<br>
		will do the trick, although this way you may end up getting some video ads too.<br>
		(You first need to activate the Advanced User mode in uBlock Origin's settings menu to 
		be able to do this. Tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIYcI2tEqo8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIYcI2tEqo8</a>)
