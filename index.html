	<h4>
		Last updated on Jul 25, 2021 20:45
	</h4>
		Please note: a bookmarklet cannot update itself. You either come back here once in a 
		while to create a new instance for yourself, or the ever evolving YouTube site will 
		eventually break it. Version number is the date of the last update, included on the 
		bookmarklet line at its very end, looking like this: /*202107252045*/
	<h1>
		Features
	</h1>
		On any YouTube video (watch) page, this bookmarklet will call an external player and load 
		some extra functions, some of which can be used with YouTube's original player as well. 
		Written in pure javascript with the aim to be as much platform-independent and 
		backwards-compatible as possible. There is no installation, it works on-demand. Only a 
		working internet connection is needed. The program is able to

	<br>
	<ol>
		<li class="feat">restrict on-site advertisement,</li>
		<li class="feat">resize, zoom, rotate and move around video picture arbitrarily,</li>
		<li class="feat">select the desired media sequence to loop,</li>
		<li class="feat">change playback rate ("speed" or tempo) from 0 or 25% to up to 500 or 1600%,</li>
		<li class="feat">load an external audio file to play alongside the current video,</li>
		<li class="feat">pick your favoured (and supported) video/audio codec and resolution for playback,</li>
		<li class="feat">download the video/audio content,</li>
		<li class="feat">download subtitles/closed captions (CC)
		<ol>
		On bookmarklet line, you can edit the value 
		of "add_subs" after the equal sign and between apostrophes (a comma separated list 
		of ISO 639-1 languge codes, such as <code>'en, de, fr, es, jp'</code>...) to add Google-Translated tracks 
		of your choice,
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li class="feat">facilitate background play while your mobile is in sleep mode (experimental)</li>
		<br>
		<li class="feat">bypass age verification (used to work when video embedding was allowed by the content owner)
		<ol>
		Examples: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07FYdnEawAQ)">Tunnel Vision (signatures encrypted)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqPsrqpwLmU">Cobra (signatures unencrypted)</a><br>
		In June 2021, YouTube shut down its old <b><strong>get_video_info</strong></b> data interface which was 
		helpful in bypassing the age-gate, thus the script has lost this feature for now even for 
		videos with less copyright protection (2nd example). :(
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li class="feat">change between YouTube layouts by setting the cookie on exit no longer works :( 
		<ol>
		YouTube stopped honoring the setting in July 2020 and shut down its classic layout for good early December.
		I wrote a userscript that partially restores it though. See the <a href="#classic_layout">YouTube Classic layout</a> section for details.
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
		Keep in mind that this is not a browser extension. If anything, it's an extension of the 
		YouTube video page. Any event resulting in a browser page refresh such as<br>
		 - leaving the current YT subdomain, <br>
		 - typing URLs directly to the address bar (instead of following links), <br>
		 - or even just navigating between two points in your browsing history where a full page 
		refresh has already taken place <br>
		will cause the program code to be removed from memory and you would need to reload it.
	<br><br>

	<h1>
		Setup
	</h1>

	<ol>
		<li>Right click / hold your finger on the Yt6 link above, and "Copy link address". If you 
		have no such option, the code is written below in plain text, select and copy it manually</li>
		<li>Bookmark any web page (this one for example)</li>
		<li>Edit the created bookmark's Properties / Location: delete its URL-address entirely, 
		and paste this snippet of javascript code in its place. (Optionally, you can give it a name 
		of your choice too.)</li>
		<li>Save the changes, if there is a Save button!</li>
	</ol>
		That's it, your bookmarklet is now ready to use.
	<br><br>
		Also, in many desktop browsers you can simply drag and drop the link to the Bookmarks 
		Toolbar, or right click on it and select "Bookmark this link".

	<h1>
		How to use
	</h1>
		<b><strong>On Desktop, just click on it on your bookmarks list</strong></b> whenever you enter a YouTube 
		video you want to play around with, unless you have the code already running.
	<br><br>
		<b><strong>On mobile, tap the browser's URL-address bar first </strong></b> (NOT the YouTube search bar!). 
		After that, the browser should suggest it as an available option once you start <b><strong>typing</strong></b> either 
		<b><strong>its name</strong></b> ("Yt6" or whatever you named it) or the prefix "javascript:" to narrow the 
		search down to bookmarklets only. <b><strong>Tapping on the correct entry</strong></b> shall initiate the call.
	<br><br>
		If it doesn't seem to work, it may be because of installed script blocker extensions. See the 
		<a href="#important_notes">Important Notes</a> section to learn how to resolve this.
	<br><br>
		Automatic playback depends on the state of YouTube's own "Repeat / Loop Playlist" 
		(the circular arrows) button on user-created playlists. 
	<br><br>
		Use the HTML5 emblem on the control panel to switch between the native and this 
		alternative player.
	<br><br>
		It is possible to use the code as a userscript with the help of addons like
	<ol>
		<b><strong>Greasemonkey</strong></b> (for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Firefox</a>),<br>
		<b><strong>Tampermonkey</strong></b> (for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd">Edge</a> and <a href="https://addons.opera.com/hu/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/">Opera</a>) or <br>
		<b><strong>Violentmonkey</strong></b> (for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/">Firefox</a>, <a href=" https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao">Edge</a>)<br>
	</ol>
		However I would not recommend this because all it does is save you the time of one or 
		two clicks/taps, while it may cause unnecessary network traffic in case of an error.

	<h1>
		Background play on Mobile
	</h1>
		You won't have to request YouTube's resource-hungry Desktop mode to be able to listen 
		to videos over a locked screen -- the site's lightweight Mobile version will do just fine. Use 
		the 48k Opus audio-only format for playback to save as much power as possible. (The 
		drop in sound quality rarely becomes noticeable.) Beside the fact that picking a video 
		format for background play is pretty much pointless, it would also raise the chance of 
		playback failure significanty. There are some browsers which don't like playing audio on 
		its own that much though.
	<br><br>
		Drawbacks:<br>
		 - the jump forward button on the locked screen's media control panel will never 
		work (by design, because they do not want you to use their site for continuous background 
		play on mobile)<br>
		 - the media controls over the screen lock provide real access only to the original player, 
		thus when the alternative player is the active one, the panel's play button is merely able to 
		kickstart it, but you can't pause it or seek forward or backward on its time rail.
	<br><br>
		I recommend to empty the device's cache before starting, it should have a positive effect 
		on performance.	(You can also check memory consumption with the memory cleaner app 
		without actually starting the cleaning procedure.)
	<br><br>
		There is an issue on mobile when you load the script after having arrived to YouTube on 
		pages of the non-video kind (like search results, channels, playlists, whatever). Namely 
		that after the initial video, further navigation to subsequent videos <b><strong>may be</strong></b> completely 
		missed by the program... I still have to remedy this occasional misbehavior, but you can 
		easily prevent it from happening in the first place by simply doing a page refresh right 
		before you would run the bookmarklet.
	<br><br>
		Another important thing to note: having Desktop view mode requested on one tab while the default 
		Mobile version of YouTube is also being used on another tab may cause the 
		script to fail. So close one or the other before trying.

	<br><br>
	<h1>
		Supported browsers
	</h1>
		<b><strong>On Desktop</strong></b>, the script should work with almost any browser now. The only criteria is that 
		they must support the usage of bookmarklets, which most of them do.
	<br><br>
		Below is a ranking of popular <b><strong>Mobile browsers</strong></b> based on how well they work <u>under the 
		following conditions</u>
<ol>
		- using the script's alternative player<br>
		- on YouTube's mobile interface (m.youtube.com)<br>
		- while the device is in actual sleep mode (screen turned off and with no connection to 
		any external power source through cable)<br>
</ol>
	<ol><p>
	<h5>
		Good ones (for Android)
	</h5>
		<li><b><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser">Brave</a></strong></b> can use the mobile UI without the help of this script
		<li><b><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vivaldi.browser">Vivaldi</a></strong></b>'s built-in Tracker and Ad Blocking can sometimes be painfully slow on YouTube, making it a severe hindrance for background play. To improve performance, you can add an exception for youtube.com ("No blocking"), and let the script handle ads
		<li><b><strong>Google Chrome</strong></b> -- its ad-flood can be neutralized fairly well now
	<h5>
		So-so (playback may fail after a few videos)

		<li><b><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser">Kiwi</a></strong></b>
		<li><b><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">Firefox</a></strong></b>'s bookmarklet support is back again <div style="display: inline; font-size: 13px">(note: last Desktop-based version was <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/mozilla/firefox/firefox-68-11-0-release/">68.11.0</a>)</div>

	<h5>
		Bad ones (playback works, just not in sleep mode)
	</h5>
		<li><b><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yandex.browser">Yandex</a></strong></b>'s performance fluctuates between OK and bad recently
		<li><b><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=acr.browser.barebones">Lightning</a></strong></b>
		<li><b><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.privateproxy.browser">Private Proxy Browser</a></strong></b>
	<h5>
		Unsupported
	</h5>
		<li><b><strong>Opera</strong></b> for mobile no longer supports bookmarklets -- one less reason to use it
		<li><b><strong>Firefox Focus, DuckDuckGo, Samsung, Qwant, Mint</strong></b> ...
	</ol></li>
		
	</p></ol>
		Of course it's possible to rank them differently with other aspects or conditions in mind.
		Their performance changes with every system-, application- or script-update which makes 
		it  difficult to pinpoint the cause of a problem newly arisen or seemingly solved. The list 
		reflects a general impression after about a year of testing on an Android phone.
	<br><br>
		Regardless of platform, the default "noname" browsers that come pre-installed on various 
		systems typically have no support for bookmarklets. If your chosen browser's response to 
		your attempt to use the bookmarklet is to pull a web search on words found on the 
		bookmarklet line, it is safe to say it doesn't support it. 

	<br><br>
	<h1>
		Legacy browsers
	</h1>
		Till June/July of 2020 the bookmarklet was usable with really old browsers too that were 
		dated back to around the IE7/8 era (with the help of the Adobe Flash plugin), but now that 
		YouTube enforces its bug-filled new layout, they broke compatibility with them.
	<br><br>
		Still, I found a way to make use of this script with outdated browsers anyway.<br>
		It's obviously discouraged to use them because of the myriad of security holes that can be 
		found in such old sowftware, not to mention that the development of Adobe Flash also 
		ended officially in 2020. It is possible to <a href="https://gist.github.com/KuromeSan/56d8b724c0696b54f9f81994ae3591d1">reactivate Flash</a>, although only Firefox 84, Edge 87, Chrome 87 and older browsers will acknowledge the presence of the plugin now. But 
		in case you have no other option, the possibility is there.
	<br><br>
		The trick is to visit the "embed" page which contains a stripped-down code normally used 
		to create an embedded video on other websites. There is literally nothing on these pages 
		beside the player itself, therefore it's super lightweight which makes it a legit choice even 
		for modern browsers (if you just want simple playback in the background). It's clunky and 
		inconvenient to use on mobile, not recommended there. On desktop, it's okay.

		<b><strong>Pro:</strong></b> the alternative player can play videos which are otherwise blocked from view 
		in embedded frames.<br>
		<b><strong>Con:</strong></b> due to a YT limitation you can only navigate through the first 200 videos on an 
		embedded playlist. The example above is the 1082th entry (indexed 1081) on the list and 
		it will load fine, but once you try to navigate, there will be no way to watch anything above index 199.

	<h1 id="classic_layout">
		Classic YouTube layout
	</h1>
		The html code of the old layout is no longer being produced by YouTube's php servers 
		(the javascript and css belonging to are is still accessible). That means we will only ever see 
		the classic layout again if we produce that html ourselves.
	<br><br>
		Based on a few backup copies of YouTube page sources, I wrote a <a href="/yt6/yt_classic.txt">userscript</a> which 
		attempts to recreate the old html structures and inject them into the current page to make 
		the two layouts co-exist at the same time.
	<br><br>
	<ol><div style="font-size: 13px">
		Note: I'm not going to update this info page every time I update the script. The above link will take you 
		directly to the plain text userscript file -- which, by the way, does absolutely nothing until you feed its text to 
		a suitable browser extension (preferably Tampermonkey). The version number in its header is the date of 
		the last edit. Update your copy if it is older than that.
	</div></ol>
	<br>
		Unfortunately, most of the server functionality 
		related to the old stuff were shut down, so there is a dependency on the new layout, which 
		makes the homemade html more like a skin than a standalone interface. It still has a few 
		advantages over the material design, such as the exact number of likes and video views, 
		or its well-defined frames.
	<br><br>
		Sadly I never made any backup copy of the html source code while being logged in to the 
		site. Those pages obviously looked and worked differently than the ones shown to 
		anonymous visitors. Searching the web for such html content left me with very limited 
		results. So don't be surprised if not everything feels exactly the way it used to.
	<br><br>
		Most bugs are attributed to the fact that the two layouts use different methods to deal with 
		browser navigation. One notable bug occurs on old-style playlists: the player keeps 
		jumping back to the video entry next to the one we started off from each time a third video 
		is about to come up. This bug can be eliminated partially by clicking the playlist's "Shuffle" 
		button (crossed arrows). The shuffle can be turned off right after it's been activated (it 
		would not have its intended effect on the player anyway), and even though the displayed 
		old html content may belong to a different video, at least the playback will work fine from 
		then on. 
	<br><br>
		It can be used independently from the main project script, <b><strong>however I advise you not to 
		use this one on Mobile.</strong></b> Kiwi and Yandex would let you install browser extensions 
		capable of running userscripts like this, but the two desktop layouts working concurrently 
		just drains the battery too fast. It's not worth it.
	<br><br>
	<h1>
		Stream capturing
	</h1>
		The yt6 script can expose URLs in the sourcechooser / download box which doesn't seem 
		to work -- there is no way to load them for playback, and trying to download the linked 
		content would either result in a zero-length file or merely a short segment of a live stream.
	<br><br>
		That's because there is no contiguous media file behind those links. Only fragments of 
		media -- hardly usable in the old-fashioned way -- meant to be streamed by a player 
		capable of streaming. You can recognize these URLs as video- or audio-only sources 
		which have no file size displayed next to them. Since a recent update of the yt6 
		code, along with the stream URLs appears a link to a "DASH Manifest", and in case of 
		live streams, a "HLS Manifest" too, which are XML documents containing info on 
		the streamable bits.
	<br><br>
		Here is one example of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ile8wMQOsMY">"yt_otf"</a> type.
	<ol><div style="font-size: 13px">
		(YouTube may occassionally replace the stream URLs with traditional media URLs. Typically happens when 
		a video reaches a certain level of popularity.)
	</div></ol>
		And here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viOkh9al0xM">"yt_live_broadcast"</a> type.
	<br><br> 
		I wrote a small <b><strong>bash shell script</strong></b> called <code style="background-color: yellow; color: red">yt_streamcat</code> which makes it possible to save 
		the media behind those type of URLs as well. It's a Command Line Interface (CLI) utility  
		which relies on a widely used binary program called <b><strong>wget</strong></b> to be installed on the system. 
		Having <b><strong>ffmpeg</strong></b>, "The swiss army knife of Internet Streaming" installed is a huge bonus, 
		and in case ffmpeg produces broken media, you may need an alternative tool capable of 
		media muxing, such as <b><strong>mencoder</strong></b>, to process the broken file and fix it for good.
	<br><br>
		The script is supplementary code to do the job which is not possible for the yt6 main 
		program in a javascript environment. Save the program file (link below) to an accessible 
		subfolder on your computer -- preferably a dedicated folder you don't mind getting filled up 
		with temporary media file segments -- open a virtual terminal with the bash shell running and 
		change working directory ("cd" in)to that folder.
	<br><br>
		Currently, the script has only a <a href="/yt6/yt_streamcat">Linux version</a> available, but it shouldn't be too hard to port 
		it to Windows.
	<br><br>
		Under Linux, newly created or downloaded files cannot be run by default, regardless of 
		whether they are meant to be executables or not. Technically speaking they are not 
		marked as executable, for security reasons. In order to make a file executable for your 
		own user only, you must run the following command at the shell prompt:<br>
	<code>chmod u+x [path to file/]filename</code>

	<br><br>
		The script command itself must be issued the following way:
	<br>
<pre>./yt_streamcat target_file "stream_base_URL" start end "2nd_stream_URL"</pre>
	<br>
		where
	<br><ol>
		<code>./</code> means the program file is located in the current directory (in Windows, <code>.\</code> would 
			mean the same thing)<br>
		<code>yt_streamcat</code>
			<ol>is the script file we run as our command</ol>
		<code>target_file</code> (mandatory)
			<ol>is a user-specified file the media segments are going to be written into -- must not 
			exist yet, if it does, the script will abort to prevent an accidental overwrite</ol>
		<code>"stream_base_URL"</code> (mandatory)
			<ol>is a YT stream source URL originating from one of the two possible types of videos 
			mentioned above, extracted by the yt6 main program. Must be enclosed in quotation 
			marks to prevent bash from misinterpreting each URL-parameter (after each "&" 
			sign) as yet another command to run in the background.</ol>
		<code>start</code> (optional)
			<ol>is the number of the segment the media should begin download from. For live 
			streams, you should give this a value somewhere between the first and last 
			available "sq" (segment query?) parameter values which you can read on the DASH and HLS 
			Manifest URL lines. If you go over that range, the download will start with the 
			most recent live segment. If you go below it, the download will stall.</ol>
		<code>end</code> (optional)
			<ol>is the number of the ending segment, or if it's less than the previous number, it will 
			be interpreted as the number of segments to download</ol>
		<code>"2nd_stream_URL"</code> (optional)
			<ol>to save another track parallel to the first one (an audio stream, maybe?). Must be 
			between quotes as well. (You must specify the previous two options in order to be 
			able to specify this fifth one.)</ol>
	<br>
		It is easier to write a wrapper script to handle the program rather than always have to 
		type out the whole command line yourself. Then just edit the part which needs to be 
		changed. The wrapper should look like something like this:
	<pre>#!/bin/bash

./yt_streamcat v \
"https://[...]googlevideo.com/videoplayback?[...]" \
100 \
150 \
"https://[...]googlevideo.com/videoplayback?[...]"
	</pre>
	<br>
		where the target file will be "v" (thus the secondary source will be saved to "vA"), 
		number 100 is going to be the first segment to be saved and 150 will be the last. Notice 
		the <code>\</code> character, which is the escape character in most programming languages. 
		It escapes a line break inside the wrapper for the lines before and after it which bash 
		is supposed to interpret as a single line of command. (No other character must be present 
		between the escape character and the following invisible newline character.) You can 
		name the wrapper file anything you want, just make it executable the same way as 
		above, then enter <code>./[wrapper_filename]</code>, and it will run the command(s) inside of it. 
	<br><br>
		One way to abort a running bash script process is to hit Ctrl+C on the terminal. A 
		temporary helper script is always generated automatically for such events to take care 
		of the remaining minimum steps in the muxing procedure. Its default filename is 
		<code>0[target_filename]-yt_streamcat-ffmpeg</code>, you just have to execute 
		it.
	<br><br>
		In my tests, live-streamed <b><strong>webm</strong></b> video content seemingly encoded as <b><strong>30fps</strong></b>, had 
		to be regularly remuxed to a framerate of anywhere between <b><strong>36 and 36.25fps</strong></b> in the saved 
		file, then also remove one segment from the beginning in order to get it synced up with 
		the audio track. No idea why that is the case, but it is. For higher framerates, the 
		difference should be even larger.
	<br><br>
	<h6>
		Remuxing commandline examples:
	</h6>
		To fix a broken mp4
	<pre>mencoder v.mp4 -ovc copy -o v2.mp4</pre>
		To change the framerate of a webm from 30 to 36
	<pre>mencoder v.webm -ovc copy -mc 0 -noskip -fps 30 -ofps 36 -o v2.webm</pre>
		To cut the first video segment out, mencoder's seek option must be a bit less than each 
		segment's duration, so if they are 5 seconds long, 4 seconds will do
	<pre>mencoder v2.webm -ovc copy -ss 4 -o v3.webm</pre>
		Finally, to mux the video and audio into one matroska file
	<pre>ffmpeg -i v3.webm -i vA.aac -c:v copy -c:a copy v.mkv</pre>
		Check if the mkv is playable, then remove the intermediate files.

	<p>
		<b style="color: red"><strong>On videos with strong copyright protection</strong></b>, it is often the case that YouTube 
		sends deliberately wrong signature decryption keys on the first try. I did not 
		implement a fully automatic update of video signatures because of the high risk of 
		infinite loop on repeated failure. <b style="color: red"><strong>You MUST switch over to the alternative player

	<p>
		The alternative player of Yt6 uses the Progressive Download method to access video & 
		audio, instead of the Adaptive Streaming YouTube's own player had as the default 
		since late 2013.
	<br><br>

		Both have their pros and cons. With the former, media is getting piled up in the browser's 
		cache during playback, which means there must be enough free space for storage either
		in the system RAM or on the disk. While in the case of streaming, you 
		only have tiny slices of the media buffered at all times, which in turn requires higher 
		CPU-power and constantly fast network speeds.
	<br>
		Consequently, for live streams or Ultra-HD videos it's recommended to switch over to 
		YouTube's native player, as it is much better suited for those.
	
	<br><br>
		To make sure your browser chooses memory over the much slower and/or fragile Hard 
		Disk / Solid-state drive for temporary storage, <strong><b>use the program in an Incognito / 
		In-private browser window or tab.</b></strong>
	</p>
	</li>
	<br>

	<p>
		Occasionally, some age-restricted videos may get the same subdomain for their 
		source location as known YouTube video commercials which have already been 
		registered with adblockers such as uBlock Origin or Brave Browser's ad-shield, and as 
		a result, their download links will be made inaccessible by these adblockers as well. 
		Except if<br>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>you are logged in to an eligible YouTube account</li>
		<li>don't use ad-blockers at all</li>
		<li>or set up exceptions in the ad-blocker's settings</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
		For example, on uBlock Origin's control panel, the explicit greenlighting of the domains
	<br><br>
		youtube.com -- for the player data and<br>
		googlevideo.com -- to access the media links<br>
	<br>
		will do the trick, although this way you may end up getting some video ads too.<br>
		(You first need to activate the Advanced User mode in uBlock Origin's settings menu to 
		be able to do this. Tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIYcI2tEqo8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIYcI2tEqo8</a>)
