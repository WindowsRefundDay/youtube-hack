Use the HTML5 emblem to switch between the native and external player. The script should at least work with newer versions of Firefox (24+). It's still buggy though.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit should go to the authors of their respective open source code:\r\n   John Dyer - Mediaelementplayer - http://mediaelementjs.com/\r\n   Christian Heilmann - Transformvideo - http://github.com/codepo8/rotatezoomHTML5video\r\n   Steven Penny - Youtube download bookmarklet - http://svnpenn.github.io/bm/   \r\nI just wrapped up to make their programs work together:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Users of FF-addon NoScript\r\n\r\n1. Take a look at the Settings of NoScript and allow (i.e. uncheck) Embedded Objects:\r\n\r\n      \\<AUDIO\\> / \\<VIDEO\\>,\r\n      \\<IFRAME\\>,\r\n      \\<FRAME\\>,\r\n      other plugins\r\n\r\n2.

Look at Firefox's internal page \"about:config\" (type it on the address bar) and set the following key(s)\r\n      \r\n      noscript.inclusionTypeChecking.exceptions - add:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snarly/yt6/master/yt6.js\r\n\r\n         If the player still won't show up, check the browser's \"Webdeveloper's Console\" to see which files NoScript has\r\n         trouble with during type checking and add their full URL-address here.\r\n\r\n      security.mixed_content.block_active_content - consider setting it to false (temporarily).\r\n\r\n         Sometimes YouTube itself mixes its own content (resources via http and https present at the same time), a\r\n         circumstance browsers are not happy about. Also, http://www.corsproxy.com, as a last resort, only supports\r\n         non-secure http connections.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
